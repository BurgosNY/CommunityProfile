		<p><h2>Background</h2></p>
 	<p>New York City has always been a city of immigrants. Since large scale immigration to the United States <a href="http://www.city-data.com/states/New-York-Migration.html
">began in the 19th century</a>, New York has been consistently at the forefront of locales that immigrants from abroad flock to. However, as time progressed, the demographics of these immigrants to New York City has changed a great deal, and along with it, so has the neighborhood makeup of the city.  Each wave of immigration from different parts of the world has contributed to the demographic mosaic, which in turn, has created trends of neighborhood shift and gentrification across the city over time.</p>

		<p><h2>Immigrant Origins</h2></p>
 	<p>The first major waves of immigration to New York City began in the mid-19th century.  This was spurred by several events, including the Irish Potato Famine.  By 1900, there were nearly half a million native-born Irish in New York City.  Following this initial wave, Germans and Eastern/Central European Jews followed, themselves followed by Italian immigrants in the early 20th century.  With each group, there was a method of settling and dispersal throughout the city region and nation, only to be replaced by more immigrants.</p>

 	<p>As the 20th century wore on, these European immigrants were replaced by people from other reaches of the world, particularly Asia, South and Central America, and the Carribean.  Each group and nationality brought their language and culture with them, often replacing areas that were once historically populated by European immigrants with their own imprint. </p>
